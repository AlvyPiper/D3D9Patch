# D3D9Patch
Bytepatches EndScene, BeginScene, CreateMove, and PaintTraverse with MSDetours, mostly public code and all sources used can be found in the main.cpp file.

I take no credit for any of the code here, this is something I whipped up really quick to show that VAC does not operate in GMod as people suspect it does, this will get you VAC banned in any other Source game.
